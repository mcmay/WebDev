This is the htdocs directory for the Apache server on my computer. The "Files" directory under this directory is for files copied here by the user with the "Uploader.jar" program and the "index.htmll" file is the web page that contains the links to the files copied. 

The user can download files by clicking/tapping the links on the index page from their browsers.
